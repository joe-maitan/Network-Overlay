# Network Overlay in Java

The objective of this project was to use Dijkstraâ€™s Shortest Paths algorithm to route packets in a Network Overlay.

I did not get to implement Dijkstra's due to the time constraint of the project, but it was a great learning experience.

What I learned about:
- I learned how to manage multiple threads and libraries.
- Create a message/wire format that the nodes would use to communicate with each other and understand.
- How this framework could be used outside of the experience of creating a small distributed system.
  
This was one of the hardest programming projects I did as a Computer Science undergraduate, but was beyond rewarding. It made me a better programmer and helped me approach problems differently.

### Notes
This project was built with Gradle. The CS department did not walk us through the download of Gradle, but instead had us load it as a module.

CS SNA Module load of Gradle (CSU CS Department command)
```
module load dev/gradle
```

Else follow Gradle download tools here: https://gradle.org/install/
