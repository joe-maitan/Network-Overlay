Using Dijkstra’s Shortest Paths to Route Packets in a Network Overlay.

The objective of this assignment is to get you familiar with coding in a distributed setting where you need to manage the underlying communications between nodes. Upon completion of this assignment you will have a set of reusable classes that you will be able to draw upon. As part of this assignment you will be: (1) constructing a logical overlay over a distributed set of nodes, and then (2) computing shortest paths using Dijkstra’s algorithm to route packets in the system.
